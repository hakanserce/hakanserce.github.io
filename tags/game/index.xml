      <description>I was looking for a site that would help me hone my coding skills in a competitive environment. I have tried sites like LeetCode, or Topcoder before, but I needed something more fun. It looks like I found what I was looking for at CodinGame. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t call it perfect, but I like the way it provides a competitive programming environment while writing game code. There are many sections in CodinGame.</description>
