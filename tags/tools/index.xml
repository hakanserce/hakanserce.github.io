      <description>&lt;p&gt;Remember when installing Java meant one download, one version, once choice? Back in the old days, you would head over to &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20030401132320/http://java.sun.com/getjava/&#34;&gt;java.sun.com&lt;/a&gt; or later to Oracle website to download the installer, click through a few prompts, and you were done. Life was simple.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Back then, there was typically one widely-adopted version of Java that would remain stable for years. You didn&amp;rsquo;t need to think much about version management because there wasn&amp;rsquo;t much to manage. Over the years, a lot has changed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
